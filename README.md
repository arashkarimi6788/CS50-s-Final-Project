## Appendix

Household Expenses is a python based application that takes users' information about what they paid for and how much they paid during a month and by pressing enter they can see the total payment from the first day of the month till the moment they enter the application.
Before starting the Coronavirus pandemic, the inflation rate in most countries was almost consistent and the amount of money paid for household expenses was almost stable too.
In recent years, the inflation rate has increased steadily, so managing the life costs helps people to survive this unstable situation. I tried to start my future plan to design such programs at the first step in this project as HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.
